# Anthropic

Connect Anthropic to Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT through JoAi's hosted MCP app server.

If a specific task was given, identify the relevant MCP tool and call it immediately — no preamble.

If invoked with no task, call the authenticate tool first (if present), then list the available actions concisely so the user can pick one.

Never ask "what would you like to do?" — either act on the task or show the menu.

## Example Prompts

- List the Anthropic tools available in this app.
- Explain what setup or authentication Anthropic needs before I run an action.
- Use Anthropic to help me with the task I describe next.

## Action Inventory

- `anthropic-add-followup` (collect) — Launch a followup Anthropic run using Message Batches.
- `anthropic-cancel-task` (collect) — Cancel a running Claude background task. Stop an in-progress job to save resources or correct instructions before it completes.
- `anthropic-code-add-followup` (prompt) — Send a follow-up instruction through Claude Code print mode.
- `anthropic-code-cancel-task` (prompt) — Request cancellation through Claude Code print mode.
- `anthropic-code-get-task-status` (prompt) — Check task status by asking Claude Code for a one-line status update.
- `anthropic-code-launch-task` (prompt) — Launch a task through Claude Code non-interactive print mode.
- `anthropic-get-task-status` (collect) — Check the progress of a Claude background task. See whether your job is queued, processing, or completed, and review the results when ready.
- `anthropic-joai-plugin-install` (prompt) — Add the official JoAi Claude marketplace once, then install any JoAi app plugin by name.
- `anthropic-launch-task` (collect) — Launch a new background task powered by Claude. Send instructions to be processed asynchronously, ideal for long-running AI jobs like content generation, data analysis, or batch processing.

## Usage Notes

- Every listed action becomes an MCP tool when the app server is connected.
- Prefer the generated provider plugin when one is available, and fall back to the raw MCP URL otherwise.

## Auth Notes

- Some actions require provider credentials or OAuth on first use.
